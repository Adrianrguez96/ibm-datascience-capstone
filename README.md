# IBM Data Science Capstone Project 2025

This repository contains the final capstone project for the **IBM Data Science and Machine Learning Course (2024/2025)**. The goal of this project is to apply the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program to solve a real-world problem using data science and machine learning techniques.

## Project Description

In this project, we take on the role of a data scientist working with New York City's **311 service request system**. This system allows residents to report non-emergency issues, and the collected data is publicly available in the city's open datasets. Over the past few years, complaints directed to the **Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD)** have significantly increased.

Our task is to analyze this data to address key questions that help the department effectively manage complaints. To achieve this, we will use various techniques, including:

- **Data Ingestion**: Collecting and loading data from multiple sources.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations in the dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Using visual tools to better understand and communicate insights.
- **Machine Learning**: Applying predictive modeling techniques to analyze complaint patterns.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance to ensure reliability and accuracy.

## Technologies Used

The project leverages several data science tools and programming languages, including:

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **SQL for Data Querying**
- **IBM Watson Studio**
- **APIs for Data Collection**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** (Regression, Classification, Clustering)

## Getting Started
