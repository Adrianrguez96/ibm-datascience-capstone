# IBM Data Science Capstone Project 2024

This repository contains the final capstone project for the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate (2024)**. The objective of this project is to apply data science and machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem using data-driven insights.

## Project Description

In this capstone project, we take on the role of a data scientist analyzing **space launch rockets**. The goal is to explore launch data, identify key success factors, and develop predictive models to assess the probability of a successful rocket launch. 

Using publicly available datasets from space agencies and private companies, we will apply various data science techniques, including:

- **Data Collection**: Gathering historical launch data from multiple sources.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns and key variables influencing launch success.
- **Data Visualization**: Using graphical tools to communicate insights effectively.
- **Machine Learning**: Developing predictive models to estimate launch outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Testing and optimizing models for accuracy and reliability.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following tools and technologies:

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **SQL for Data Querying**
- **IBM Watson Studio**
- **APIs for Data Collection**
- **Machine Learning Models** (Regression, Classification)
